# SNHU-Security-CS305
<h4>1.Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing? </h4>
<p> Artermis Financial want their web application secured to protect their client data and financial information from cyber hacking. They want to implement a cipher algorithm for data verification as a secure communication mechanism. From depedency check, there are too many vulnerabilites in their code base, so to code securely, always apply best practice from vulnerabilities assessmnet process flow.</p>
<h4>2.What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? </h4>
<p> The most helpful part is the vulnerabilities assessmnet process flow diagram.It helps me understand the process of making a secured code base from analyzing the application structure and implementing appropriate methods for the code structure in order to protect data integrity.</p> 
<h4>3.How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?</h4>
<p> To increase layers of security, I added some input validation from user's input to improve code quality
<h4>4.How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?</H4>
<p> I refactored the code by implementing SHA-256 algorithm to the ServerController in order to generate a hash value for verification. 
<h4>5.What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?</h4>
<p>This task require a generate key and sever certificate with a modified application properties within the code base for it to be functional, and a maven dependency check to examine any vulnerabilities. 
<h4>6.Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?</h4>
<p> From this assignment, I understand the important of security in coding structure better. I know what and where to apply any security methods in the code base, and use dependency check to inspect any vulnerabilities</p>
